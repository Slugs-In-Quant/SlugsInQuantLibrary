# SlugsInQuantLibrary
Here will be a collection of various exercises, calculators, demonstrative strategies, backtests and other useful resources.
The majority, if not all code will be in Python.
Any strategy displayed in this library does NOT claim to be profitable or robust enough to be run using real money.
If making the unwise decision of putting a strategy into use, do not blame me.
Backtesting resources provided may unintentionally include various biases or forget important data, including but not limited to,
Look-Ahead Bias, Survivorship Bias, Curve-Fitting, Slippage and Commission Cost, Realistic Order Fills.
I will try not to do this though.
Thanks.
